        | ready on the hearth. He got up from the sofa and put them all in the
        | fireplace. He watched until they flamed. Then he finished his soda and
        | made for the patio door. On the way, he saw the pies lined up on the

        | that needed talking about, important things that had to be discussed.
        |       They’d talk again. Maybe after the holidays were over and things got back
        |       to normal. He’d tell her the goddamn ashtray was a goddamn dish, for
        |       example.

        | a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by
        | arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
