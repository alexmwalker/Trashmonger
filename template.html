        A small wax and sawdust log burned on the grate. A carton of five more sat
        ready on the hearth. He got up from the sofa and put them all in the
        fireplace. He watched until they flamed. Then he finished his soda and
        made for the patio door. On the way, he saw the pies lined up on the
        sideboard. He stacked them in his arms, all six, one for every ten times
        she had ever betrayed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        He left through the patio door. He was not certain, but he thought he had
        proved something. He hoped he had made something clear.<a href="#">The thing was, they had to have a serious talk soon. There were things </a>that needed talking about, important things that had to be discussed.
              They’d talk again. Maybe after the holidays were over and things got back
              to normal. He’d tell her the goddamn ashtray was a goddamn dish, for
              example.
      </p>
      <p>We opened our eyes and turned in bed to take a good look at each other.<a href="#">We both knew it</a> then. We'd reached the end of something,
              and the thing was to find out where new to start.

        This is an especially small paragraph style not designed for large, wide
        body text areas. It is best suited to be used in visually dense or complex
        UI elements like cards, bio panels, and testimonial layouts. It tends to
        work well with H5 headings.

        From troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
        horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head
        a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by
        arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and
        seemed ready to slide off any moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him,
        waved about helplessly as he looked. “What’s happened to me?” he thought.
        It wasn’t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too
        small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.

        They had laughed. They had leaned on each other and laughed until the
        tears had come, while everything else--the cold, and where he'd go in
        it–was outside, for a while anyway.

        Drinking’s funny. When I look back on it, all of our important decisions
        have been figured out when we were drinking. Even when we talked about
        having to cut back on drinking, we’d be sitting at the kitchen table or
        out at the picnic table with a six-pack or whiskey.
